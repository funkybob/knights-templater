Introduction
============

This is one of my many template engine projects.

My specific focus this time was to use Python to compile the tag expressions,
and then use AST NodeTransformers to alter them to "work".

(See `Green Tree Snakes`_ for an excellent introductin to Python AST.)

Quick Start
===========

Compile and render a template from a string:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import knights
    >>> tclass = knights.kompile('Hello {{ name }}, how are you?')
    >>> t = tclass()
    >>> print(t({'name': 'Bob'}))
    Hello Bob, how are you?

Load a template from a directory:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from knights import loader
   >>> loader.add_path('templates/')
   >>> tclass = loader.load_template('index.html')
   >>> t = tclass()
   >>> t.render({....})
   ...
